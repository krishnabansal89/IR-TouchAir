## Introduction

Have you ever imagined controlling your computer with just a wave of your hand? This project makes that dream a reality by utilizing infrared sensors to detect your finger movements and translating them into various PC actions like scrolling, swiping, and more.

## Features

- Gesture recognition: Detects finger movements accurately.
- PC interaction: Translates gestures into PC actions.
- Learning platform: Perfect for beginners to learn about Arduino, electronics, and coding.
- Customizable: Easily tweak gestures and PC actions to your preferences.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Gesture-Controlled PC Movements project:

### Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Infrared sensors
- Resistors (for pull-down)
- Connecting wires
- USB cable

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

2. Set up your hardware components according to the provided circuit diagram.

3. Upload the Arduino sketch (`gesture_controlled_pc.ino`) to your Arduino board.

### Usage

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable.
git clone https://github.com/krishnabansal89/IR-TouchAir.git

2. Run the uploaded sketch on the Arduino.

3. Hold your hand over the infrared sensors and start making gestures.

4. Observe how the Arduino translates your gestures into various PC movements.
